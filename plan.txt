## WHAT'S REMAINING (Out of Scope for MVP)

### Features Intentionally Excluded
These were listed in the original plan as "Exclude for MVP":

1. **Double Elimination / Consolation Brackets**
   - Current: Single-elimination only
   - Future: Add losers bracket

2. **Paid Registration / Payments**
   - Current: Free registration
   - Future: Integrate Stripe or similar

3. **Advanced Seeding Rules**
   - Current: Simple DUPR descending sort
   - Future: Gender divisions, skill brackets, manual seeding

4. **Player Profiles & Analytics**
   - Current: Basic player info (name, email, DUPR)
   - Future: Match history, win/loss records, ranking trends

5. **Authentication / Authorization**
   - Current: Open access (anyone can create tournaments, submit scores)
   - Future: Supabase Auth, role-based access (admin, referee, player)

6. **Score History / Audit Log**
   - Current: Only latest score stored
   - Future: View all score submissions, undo functionality

7. **Match Scheduling**
   - Current: All matches scheduled immediately
   - Future: Court assignments, time slots, notifications

8. **Tournament Types**
   - Current: Single-elimination only
   - Future: Round-robin, Swiss system, pool play

9. **Mobile Optimization**
   - Current: Works on mobile but not optimized
   - Future: Mobile-first design, native app

10. **Export Functionality**
    - Current: No export
    - Future: Export brackets to PDF, CSV, share links

### Known Limitations / Tech Debt

1. **Error Handling**
   - Could be more robust (currently basic alerts)
   - Should add toast notifications

2. **Loading States**
   - Basic loading indicators
   - Could add skeletons, better UX

3. **Validation**
   - Score validation is simple (best of 3)
   - Could enforce pickleball rules (11 points, win by 2)

4. **Database Constraints**
   - No unique constraints on player emails
   - No prevention of duplicate registrations

5. **Real-time Performance**
   - Works fine for small tournaments
   - May need optimization for 100+ player tournaments
